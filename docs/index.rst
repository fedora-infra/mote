General advice on reStructuredText
**********************************

Writing reStructuredText is not intuitive to a first-time author.
Therefore, I find using a set of common standards is helpful to maintain style and consistency across documentation.
For reStructuredText specifically, two places with helpful markup documentation are listed below:

* `Quick reStructuredText reference <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
* `Sphinx documentation <https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/sphinx/stable/sphinx.pdf>`_

Additionally, I always use the `Sphinx style guide <https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/>`_ for writing the same style across documents.
