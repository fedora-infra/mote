Møte: A history
===============

Møte first began on 2015 May 6 by Fedora Infrastructure contributor Chaoyi Zha (cydrobolt).
Together with the mentorship of Ralph Bean (threebean), they created the first prototype of Møte to improve quality-of-life for Fedora's long-time IRC meeting formats.

_More coming soon_.
