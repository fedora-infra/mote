### Contribute to møte

You can contribute code or data. møte is in need of contributors to increase its name association data pool.
Some of the meeting groups' names are difficult to understand: for instance, the term `famna` may be unfamiliar to prospective ambassadors. To help add friendlier names and create a clear grouping of meeting groups, you can fork, edit, and send a pull request to the following data files:

 - [name_mappings](https://github.com/fedora-infra/mote/blob/master/name_mappings.json)
 - [category_mappings](https://github.com/fedora-infra/mote/blob/master/category_mappings.json)
