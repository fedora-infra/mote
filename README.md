# Mote 2.0 (Meetbot Logs 2.0)

Mote (or Meetbot Logs) is a web service that aggregates and distributes summaries, minutes and logs of meetings
that takes place in an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) or 
[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)) channel for the Fedora Project.

## Features

The web service has the following features

- Chronological lookup of meeting summaries, minutes and logs using an interactive calendar view
- Snappier loading up of content due to application-like interface and behaviour of the web service
- Channel-wise and date-wise distinction of meeting summaries, minutes and logs within modals
- Faster intuitive search of meeting summaries, minutes and logs using asynchronous fetching

## Setup

### Preliminary setup

1. Fork the repository.
   ```
   https://github.com/fedora-infra/mote
   ```
2. Clone the forked repository to your local storage.
   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/mote.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the cloned repository.
   ```
   $ cd mote
   ```
4. Depending on the kind of approach required, follow either of the below sections.

### Containerized setup

1. Install [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) on Fedora Linux.
   ```
   $ sudo dnf install podman
   ```
2. Download meeting logs in the directory of the cloned repository.

   - To download logs from a specific channel, append the channel name to the URL. For instance, for the "fedora-meeting" channel, use https://meetbot-raw.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/.
   ```
   $ wget -r -P "./meetbot" -nH -R "index.html,robots.txt" -A ".html,.txt" https://meetbot-raw.fedoraproject.org/
   ```
3. Build the container image.
   ```
   $ podman build -t mote .
   ```
4. Start the development server on an IPv4 address and on port 9696.
   ```
   $ podman run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 -v ./meetbot:/srv/web/meetbot:Z -v ./mote:/opt/app/mote:Z mote
   ```

### Native setup

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) on Fedora Linux.
   ```
   $ sudo dnf install python3 python3-virtualenv poetry
   ```
2. Download meeting logs in the `/srv/web` directory.

   - To download logs from a specific channel, append the channel name to the URL. For instance, for the "fedora-meeting" channel, use https://meetbot-raw.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/.
   ```
   $ sudo mkdir -p /srv/web
   $ sudo chown $USER /srv/web
   $ wget -r -P "/srv/web/meetbot" -nH -R "index.html,robots.txt" -A ".html,.txt" https://meetbot-raw.fedoraproject.org/
   ```
3. Create and activate the virtual environment.
   ```
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the defined packages from the Python project configuration file.
   ```
   $ (venv) poetry install
   ```
5. Start the development server on an IPv4 address and on port 9696.
   ```
   $ (venv) mote -p 9696 -4
   ```

## Accessing

The project is be served on http://localhost:9696/ and with appropriate firewall rules, it should be accessible to the devices connected to the same network.
